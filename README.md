Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW).

Create a delivery plan that minimizes 1) the total travel distance 2) the number of trucks used
and 3) Total cost incurred while satisfying the constraints related to vehicle capacities, customer 
time windows,and vehicles allowed at each order location and compare the results obtained for each objective.

Assumed fixed cost of vehicles as 2*(Capacity of vehicle) and per km variable cost as (20000-capacity)/1000.

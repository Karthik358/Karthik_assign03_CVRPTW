Dealing with infeasibility

Save the model as a mps file in pulp, then use gurobi_cl and ask the command-line tool to write a .ilp format file.
It will attempt to solve the model, and if the model is found to be infeasible, it will automatically compute an IIS and write it to the requested file name.

Some useful terminal commands
gurobi_cl model.mps

Setting Parameters
gurobi_cl TimeLimit=20 model.mps

Attempt to solve the model, if found infeasible writes IIS to specified file.
gurobi_cl ResultFile=model.ilp model.mps

Irreducible Inconsistent Subsystem (IIS). 
An IIS is a subset of the constraints and variable bounds with the following properties:
- It is still infeasible, and
- If a single constraint or bound is removed, the subsystem becomes feasible. 

Note that an infeasible model may have multiple IISs. The one returned by Gurobi is not necessarily the smallest one; there may exist others with fewer constraints or bounds.
